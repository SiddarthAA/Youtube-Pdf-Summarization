[7.32 - 13.20] It's 4 a.m.,  and the big test is in eight hours,
[13.20 - 16.12] followed by a piano recital.
[16.12 - 21.89] You've been studying and playing for days, but you still don't feel ready for either.
[21.89 - 23.32] So, what can you do?
[23.32 - 25.32] Well, you can drink another cup of coffee
[25.32 - 28.08] and spend the next few hours  cramming and practicing,
[28.08 - 30.00] but believe it or not,
[30.00 - 33.48] you might be better off closing the books, putting away the music,
[33.48 - 35.82] and going to sleep.
[35.82 - 38.18] Sleep occupies nearly  a third of our lives,
[38.18 - 43.15] but many of us give surprisingly little attention and care to it.
[43.15 - 46.73] This neglect is often the result  of a major misunderstanding.
[46.73 - 48.64] Sleep isn't lost time,
[48.64 - 52.33] or just a way to rest  when all our important work is done.
[52.33 - 54.34] Instead, it's a critical function,
[54.34 - 58.76] during which your body balances and regulates its vital systems,
[58.76 - 60.35] affecting respiration
[60.35 - 65.44] and regulating everything from circulation to growth and immune response.
[65.44 - 70.82] That's great, but you can worry about  all those things after this test, right?
[70.82 - 72.44] Well, not so fast.
[72.44 - 75.47] It turns out that sleep  is also crucial for your brain,
[75.47 - 78.17] with a fifth of your body's  circulatory blood
[78.17 - 80.85] being channeled to it as you drift off.
[80.85 - 83.46] And what goes on  in your brain while you sleep
[83.46 - 86.54] is an intensely active period  of restructuring
[86.54 - 89.36] that's crucial for how our memory works.
[89.36 - 90.36] At first glance,
[90.36 - 94.25] our ability to remember things  doesn't seem very impressive at all.
[94.25 - 97.04] 19th century psychologist  Herman Ebbinghaus
[97.04 - 100.91] demonstrated that we normally forget 40% of new material
[100.91 - 103.39] within the first twenty minutes,
[103.39 - 107.13] a phenomenon known as the forgetting curve.
[107.13 - 110.73] But this loss can be prevented  through memory consolidation,
[110.73 - 113.29] the process by which information is moved
[113.29 - 118.90] from our fleeting short-term memory to our more durable long-term memory.
[118.90 - 122.62] This consolidation occurs with the help of a major part of the brain,
[122.62 - 125.34] known as the hippocampus.
[125.34 - 127.36] Its role in long-term memory formation
[127.36 - 131.37] was demonstrated in the 1950s by Brenda Milner
[131.37 - 134.66] in her research with  a patient known as H.M.
[134.66 - 136.96] After having his hippocampus removed,
[136.96 - 141.32] H.M.'s ability to form new short-term memories was damaged,
[141.32 - 145.89] but he was able to learn physical tasks through repetition.
[145.89 - 147.72] Due to the removal of his hippocampus,
[147.72 - 152.29] H.M.'s ability to form long-term memories was also damaged.
[152.29 - 154.44] What this case revealed, among other things,
[154.44 - 157.36] was that the hippocampus  was specifically involved
[157.36 - 162.06] in the consolidation of long-term declarative memory,
[162.06 - 165.32] such as the facts and concepts you need to remember for that test,
[165.32 - 167.12] rather than procedural memory,
[167.12 - 171.73] such as the finger movements you need to master for that recital.
[171.73 - 175.39] Milner's findings, along with work  by Eric Kandel in the 90's,
[175.39 - 180.75] have given us our current model  of how this consolidation process works.
[180.75 - 182.80] Sensory data is initially transcribed
[182.80 - 187.07] and temporarily recorded in the neurons as short-term memory.
[187.07 - 189.62] From there, it travels to the hippocampus,
[189.62 - 193.15] which strengthens and enhances  the neurons in that cortical area.
[193.15 - 195.37] Thanks to the phenomenon of neuroplasticity,
[195.37 - 200.34] new synaptic buds are formed, allowing new connections between neurons,
[200.34 - 202.18] and strengthening the neural network
[202.18 - 205.93] where the information will be returned as long-term memory.
[205.93 - 208.80] So why do we remember some things and not others?
[208.80 - 210.69] Well, there are a few ways to influence
[210.69 - 214.30] the extent and effectiveness  of memory retention.
[214.30 - 218.44] For example, memories that are formed in times of heightened feeling,
[218.44 - 219.47] or even stress,
[219.47 - 224.73] will be better recorded due to  the hippocampus' link with emotion.
[224.73 - 228.72] But one of the major factors contributing to memory consolidation is,
[228.72 - 229.89] you guessed it,
[229.89 - 231.88] a good night's sleep.
[231.88 - 234.21] Sleep is composed of four stages,
[234.21 - 236.95] the deepest of which are known as slow-wave sleep
[236.95 - 239.23] and rapid eye movement.
[239.23 - 242.39] EEG machines monitoring people during these stages
[242.39 - 244.38] have shown electrical impulses
[244.38 - 249.69] moving between the brainstem, hippocampus, thalamus, and cortex,
[249.69 - 253.53] which serve as relay stations  of memory formation.
[253.53 - 256.90] And the different stages of sleep have been shown to help consolidate
[256.90 - 259.11] different types of memories.
[259.11 - 262.56] During the non-REM slow-wave sleep,
[262.56 - 266.12] declarative memory is encoded  into a temporary store
[266.12 - 268.95] in the anterior part of the hippocampus.
[268.95 - 272.79] Through a continuing dialogue  between the cortex and hippocampus,
[272.79 - 275.50] it is then repeatedly reactivated,
[275.50 - 281.00] driving its gradual redistribution to long-term storage in the cortex.
[281.00 - 284.88] REM sleep, on the other hand, with its similarity to waking brain activity,
[284.88 - 288.47] is associated with the consolidation of procedural memory.
[288.47 - 290.31] So based on the studies,
[290.31 - 293.53] going to sleep three hours after  memorizing your formulas
[293.53 - 298.52] and one hour after practicing your scales would be the most ideal.
[298.51 - 301.02] So hopefully you can see now that skimping on sleep
[301.02 - 303.29] not only harms your long-term health,
[303.29 - 305.07] but actually makes it less likely
[305.07 - 309.42] that you'll retain all that knowledge and practice from the previous night,
[309.42 - 313.54] all of which just goes to affirm the wisdom of the phrase, "Sleep on it."
[313.54 - 315.64] When you think about  all the internal restructuring
[315.64 - 319.37] and forming of new connections that occurs while you slumber,
[319.37 - 321.28] you could even say that proper sleep
[321.28 - 325.09] will have you waking up every morning with a new and improved brain,
[325.09 - 327.59] ready to face the challenges ahead.
